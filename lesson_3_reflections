REFLECTION: When would you want to use a remote repository 
rather than keeping all your work local?

If your project is large, you want/need to work on it from 
different locations, different people will be working on it.


REFLECTION: Why might you want to always pull changes manually 
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It's good to make meaningful commits that make clear sense to you.
